# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Kaizen Flow

## 1. Project Overview

Kaizen Flow is a React Native mobile app designed to utilize voice as the sole means of user interaction and feedback. Built using the Expo framework and integrating Firebase for authentication and data management, the app helps individuals struggling with cognitive stress, social anxiety, and confidence issues. It does so by guiding them through six cognitive frameworks promoting self-care and growth, all via voice commands.

Central to Kaizen Flow is its AI-driven interaction, where users are led through each framework with AI-generated questions and responses that adapt to user input in real-time. This innovative approach leverages any Large Language Model (LLM) such as OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Bard to deliver a personalized journaling experience.

Objectives include creating a seamless voice interaction flow, secure session management, a modern UI inspired by Mindsera's card-based navigation, and fostering meaningful self-reflection through AI-generated journal entries. Success will be measured by the app's effectiveness in processing voice inputs, engaging users through interactive frameworks, and generating insightful, AI-driven journal content.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   iOS and Android app development using React Native and Expo.
*   Exclusive voice-interaction model; no standard keyboard input.
*   Firebase Authentication for secure email/password and Google sign-in.
*   Firebase Firestore integration for data and journal entry storage.
*   AI-driven sessions with adaptive questions leveraging LLMs to guide users.
*   Implementation of six cognitive frameworks: First Principles Thinking, Gratitude Mapping, Cognitive Reframing, Socratic Questioning, Calm Anchor Technique, and Growth Mindset Reframe.
*   Initial voice calibration for improved command recognition.
*   AI-generated, text-based journal summaries stored in a dedicated tab.
*   Card UI design blending pastel gradations and intuitive icons, inspired by Mindsera.
*   Firebase Cloud Messaging for customizable voice reminders with default bi-daily setting.
*   Thorough error handling and adaptive fallback mechanisms for voice command errors.
*   Comprehensive Markdown documentation detailing architecture, APIs, and maintainable code annotations.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Administrative web interface (separate project scope).
*   Complex user role structures beyond initial free and paid tier models.
*   Manual editing of AI-generated session content.
*   Expanded UI theme customization beyond existing design framework.
*   Permanent reliance on touch input; temporary fallback only.
*   Extensive analytics or emotional insight KPIs (potential for future projects).
*   Localization beyond English voice commands at launch.

## 3. User Flow

Upon launching Kaizen Flow, the user receives a voice initiation message: "Welcome to Kaizen Flow. Say the name of a cognitive framework or list available frameworks to begin." Users authenticate via Firebase with options for email or Google sign-in. First-time users undergo a brief voice training session to calibrate speech recognition, crucial for ensuring accuracy throughout the application.

Post-training, users navigate the app's main dashboard, choosing frameworks displayed on themed cards. Speaking a framework's name, like "Select Gratitude Mapping," initiates AI-guided prompts tailored to user's responses, ensuring adaptive engagement. Sessions conclude with AI-generated text summaries, logged under a Journal Entry tab. Users can access previous sessions or start a new framework with simple verbal commands such as "Show Journal Entry" or "Begin Cognitive Reframing."
