# Voice Service Best Practices

## Audio Recording
- Optimize audio recording settings for speech recognition (mono, reduced sample rate)
- Implement proper permission handling with clear user messaging
- Always provide visual feedback when recording is active
- Implement silence detection to automatically stop recording
- Set reasonable maximum recording durations (15-30 seconds)

## Speech Recognition
- Implement a fallback chain for speech recognition:
  1. Whisper API (high accuracy)
  2. On-device recognition (faster, works offline)
- Cache recognition results when appropriate
- Implement language detection or allow language selection
- Handle partial results for faster feedback
- Provide confidence scores when available

## Text-to-Speech
- Use natural-sounding voices appropriate for your application
- Allow users to select preferred voice/gender
- Implement proper rate and pitch controls
- Cache commonly used phrases for faster playback
- Respect system accessibility settings

## Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages for common issues:
  - Microphone permission denied
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Service unavailability
  - Unintelligible speech
- Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Provide helpful recovery suggestions to users

## Performance Optimization
- Release audio resources when not in use
- Implement proper cleanup in component unmount
- Use appropriate audio quality settings based on use case
- Optimize audio file size for network transmission
- Implement caching for frequently used audio files

## User Experience
- Provide clear visual indicators during:
  - Waiting for permission
  - Recording
  - Processing
  - Speaking
- Implement cancellation options during long operations
- Show transcription results in real-time when possible
- Provide feedback on audio levels during recording
- Allow users to retry failed recognition attempts

## Testing
- Test with various accents and speech patterns
- Test in noisy environments
- Test with different microphone qualities
- Verify behavior with slow network connections
- Test fallback mechanisms by simulating service failures
