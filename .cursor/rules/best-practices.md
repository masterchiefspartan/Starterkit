# Best Practices for Kaizen Flow

## Code Structure
- Follow a consistent folder structure:
  - `src/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `src/screens`: Full application screens
  - `src/services`: Business logic and API services
  - `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks
  - `src/utils`: Helper functions and utilities
  - `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `src/constants`: Application constants
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Implement proper type definitions for all functions and components

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state when appropriate
- Implement proper state initialization and updates
- Use reducers for complex state logic
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or composition
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Lazy load components and assets when possible
- Use proper image optimization techniques

## Styling
- Use a consistent styling approach (styled-components, StyleSheet, etc.)
- Implement a theme system for colors, typography, and spacing
- Support dark mode and light mode
- Ensure proper accessibility (contrast, touch targets, etc.)
- Use responsive design principles

## API Integration
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use a consistent approach for API requests (axios, fetch, etc.)
- Implement request caching when appropriate
- Handle loading and error states for all API calls
- Implement proper retry logic for failed requests

## Navigation
- Use React Navigation for consistent navigation
- Implement proper deep linking support
- Handle navigation state persistence
- Implement proper navigation guards for protected routes
- Use screen options consistently

## Testing
- Write unit tests for critical business logic
- Implement component tests for UI components
- Use integration tests for complex workflows
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Use snapshot testing for UI components

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper focus management
- Provide alternative text for images
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Support screen readers

## Documentation
- Document complex business logic
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Create README files for major features
- Document API integrations
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
