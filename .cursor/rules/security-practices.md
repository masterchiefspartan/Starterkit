# Security Best Practices

## API Keys and Secrets
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets directly in the source code
- Use environment variables or secure storage solutions for sensitive data
- In React Native, use a package like `react-native-dotenv` or `react-native-config` for environment variables
- For the Whisper API key, ensure it's stored securely and not exposed in client-side code

## Data Handling
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement request timeouts for all network requests
- Validate all API responses before processing

## Authentication
- Implement proper token-based authentication
- Use secure storage for auth tokens (e.g., `expo-secure-store`)
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Set appropriate token expiration times
- Never store passwords in plain text

## Mobile-Specific Security
- Request only necessary permissions
- Implement certificate pinning for critical API endpoints
- Use biometric authentication when appropriate
- Implement app timeout/auto-logout for sensitive features
- Disable screenshots for screens with sensitive information

## Voice Service Security
- Inform users when audio recording is active
- Delete audio recordings after processing
- Implement rate limiting for API calls to Whisper
- Validate audio data before sending to external services
- Implement fallback mechanisms for when external services are unavailable

## Debugging
- Use conditional logging that's disabled in production
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use a centralized error tracking service
- Sanitize error messages shown to users
